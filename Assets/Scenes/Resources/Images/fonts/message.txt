How to connect to WPA2/PEAP/MSCHAPv2 enterprise wifi networks that don't use a CA_Certificate, like Eduroam

My university uses WPA2 Enterprise encryption for students to login their wireless. In NetworkManager I have keyed in everything that they needed

Security : WPA & WPA2 Enterprise
Authentication : Protected EAP (PEAP)
CA certificate is not needed
PEAP version : Automatic
Inner authentication : MSCHAPv2
Username and Password are correct.
Everytime I try to connect, I get a window asking me to input my password over and over again

There is a bug report here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/1104476

A workaround is to remove the line

system-ca-cert=true
from the configuration file found in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/

Here's a work around.

Open a terminal (Alt + F2) and run the following commands:

cd /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections
sudo touch SSID #SSID is the name of the profile, e.g. eduroam
sudo nano SSID
Then edit the "SSID" profile as following:

[ipv6]
method=auto

[connection]
id=SSID #(e.g.EDUroam)
uuid=9e123fbc-0123-46e3-97b5-f3214e123456 #unique uuid will be created upon creation of this profile
type=802-11-wireless

[802-11-wireless-security]
key-mgmt=wpa-eap
auth-alg=open

[802-11-wireless
ssid=SSID
mode=infrastructure
mac-address=0A:12:3C:DA:C1:A5
security=802-11-wireless-security

[802-1x]
eap=peap;
identity=studentid123123
phase2-auth=mschapv2
password=mypass123123

[ipv4]
method=auto
Modify the above file and it should work.

I had the same problem at work I followed the instructions and changed the system-ca-cert=false but I also had to go in and change the wireless driver settings once I made the changes it connected right up. check out the link where I got the info below
